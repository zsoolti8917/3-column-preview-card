## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned a lot about Grid, watching tutorials and reading the documentation. I also played with the :hover selector to change the background color of the buttons and transition / transform to add a little animation. It was a very good project to practice the variables in CSS.
Had chance to practice the media queries as well.

### Continued development

I don't plan to improve the gode of this project, i'm happy with the result. I will continue to learn about Grid and Flexbox, and i will try to use them more effectively in my future projects.
